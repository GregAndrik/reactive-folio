      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        My passion for programming ignited during my high school years when I was first introduced to it through my school's curriculum. Even before completing high school,
        programming had evolved into a lasting hobby that led me to envision a career path with certainty. I pursued my education at the University of Thessaly, earning a Bachelor's
        degree in Computer Engineering. This academic journey has been complemented by continuous personal research and skill refinement. Alongside, I am enthusiastic about 
        exploring various web technologies that capture my interest, thereby cultivating a versatile skill set to contribute effectively within development teams. My aspiration is 
        to work with the best and learn from the best, absorbing knowledge and broadening my expertise across diverse IT domains.
      </p>
      <h3>Soft skills:</h3>
      <p>
        I bring with me a few good years of valuable experience as an IT teacher. This role has taught me to adeptly tailor my teaching approach to accommodate varying learning paces, 
        enabling me to effectively impart knowledge to a wide range of students, including those with unique learning needs that demand additional patience. Through this experience,
        I have honed the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components, facilitating better comprehension and problem-solving. Naturally, my communication skills 
        have seen significant enhancement. 
      </p>
      <h3>Hard skills:</h3>
      <p>
        My current skill set comprises both Front-End and Back-End technologies, each of which captivates me for distinct reasons. As a junior developer, I dedicate my primary focus
        to Front-End development. However, I foresee a future where I aspire to evolve into a Fullstack developer. This direction aligns with my appreciation for both aspects of 
        software development; I'm determined not to miss out on the experience that Fullstack development offers. Moreover, I am comfortable on linux environments, while also 
        favoring Windows' WSL2 implementation. This preference arises from the belief that it combines the best attributes of both operating systems, providing a versatile and 
        efficient environment.
      </p>
      <h3>As a colleague:</h3>
      <p>
        I have a keen habit of observing the work and methodologies of others, absorbing the most effective aspects associated with their techniques. I then integrate these insights
        into my own approach, ensuring efficiency while also adding my personal touch. I am always eager to share newfound knowledge and be a helping hand to newer colleagues,
        mirroring the support I have received from others in my journey.
      </p>
      <h3>As a developer:</h3>
      <p>
        I am adaptable to change, and make it a point to stay current with the latest trends. My inclination towards clean and efficient practices, which eliminate any scope for 
        misinterpretation, is unwavering. I am dedicated to incorporating scalability into my work, ensuring seamless integration of future additions to projects without having to 
        discard substantial past efforts. Regardless of the project I am working on, I consistently aim for a clean, easily maintainable, and well documented codebase.
